# Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
This assignment focuses on what are the factors that determine a customer (as a driver) is likely to accept a driving coupon or not. 

## Overview
In order to explore data, I define and reclassify the data, omit useless or missing data and reshape the data into a new easy readable DataFrame before I dig into any further data analysis.

In this data analysis, I utilize plotting, statistical summaries and visualization with Python (along with libraries like pandas and seaborn), to briefly summarize the different between drivers who are more likely to accept the coupons under their unique situations.

## Conclusion
My analysis found that certain coupon types (for example, Bar and Coffee House) are intended to target different groups of drivers base on their various situation (for example, passenger types, occupations, etc.) 

Use Bar coupon as an example, my analysis found that the more times customers went to a Bar once a month, the higher chance for customers to accept the Bar coupon. Customers who were driving without Kids and also their occupations were not farmers more likely to accept the Bar coupon.

Another example with Coffee House, my analysis found that customers who were driving with Friend(s) or Partner have higher Coffee House coupon acceptance ratio than customers who were driving Alone or with Kids.

## Next step and Recommendations
Customers' age, occupation, marital status, and income could also influence customers' decision making, but will need further investigation to define the impact as an individual factor or as a group factors.
